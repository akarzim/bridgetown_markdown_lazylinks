This is my text and [this is my link][*]. I'll define
the url for that link under the paragraph.

I can use [multiple][*] lazy links in [a paragraph][*],
and then just define them in order below it.

I can also use [a custom placeholder][-] acting like the [default star][-].

[-]: https://example.org/custom
[-]: https://example.org/default

And now, [external links][+] can be flagged as external relation and target a
blank new browser tab.

[+]: https://example.org/external

Of course, [external][@] lazylinks are [customizable][@] too!
